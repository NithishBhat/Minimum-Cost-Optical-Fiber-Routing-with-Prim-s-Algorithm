Minimum-Cost-Optical-Fiber-Routing-with-Prim-s-Algorithm

The goal of the project is to find a minimum spanning tree  for a graph built on coordinate points of a real world city and find the least possible time complexity.


This project was a part of  Northeastern's MSCS CS5800. its was a group project , but i am going to include the part of the project i was responsible for. That is the coding  of prims and runtime measurements. The overall project was to find the Minimum-Cost-Optical-Fiber-Routing with 2 different algorithms and then comapre the efficiences of them both and the accuracy of the final minimum spanning tree.
